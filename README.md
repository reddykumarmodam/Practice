# Practice - Anagrams 
Sample program to check strings are Anagrams or not.
To check Anagrams strings should be of equal length. If the length is not equal then the Strings are not Anagrams.
Approach:
1. Input is read from the console using Scanner class.
2. Once the input is read and strings are converted to lower casse(Just for simplicity).
3. Length has to be checked for strings. 
4. If the length is not equal then the strings are not Anagrams.
5. The given input is converted to the character arrays and sorted. Once sorted, two strings are compared for equality.
6. If the strings are equal then output is given as Anagrams.
7. if the strings are not equal then output is given as Not Anagrams.
